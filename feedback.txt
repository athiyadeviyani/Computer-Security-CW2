Hello s1709906,

Given the size of the class we have to rely on auto-graders. This
coursework being newly designed for this year, our autograders had not
been tested extensively before. For this reason, there were some bugs
and some marks initially sent out were not right. After sending out the
CW2 feedback on April 5, several of you inquired about your marks giving
us feedback that helped us fix our autograders. The TAs have been
working on this over the past few days and have corrected the issues
reported. Below you will find your actual CW2 score.


- GPG: 20 out of 20

- Email spoofing: 10 out of 10

- Password cracking: 10 out of 10, 10 out of 10, 10 out of 10

- MitM attack: 40 out of 40

- Late submission penalties: 0

This brings your total score for CW2 to: 100 out of 100.


I hope you are well and that you are keeping in good spirit.

Keep safe!

Myrto
